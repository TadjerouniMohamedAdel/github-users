## Quick Setup

installing depencies

```bash
yarn
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

## Testing

```bash
yarn test
```

## Live demo

i deployed the app on netlify : <a href="https://github-users-team.netlify.app/" target="_blank">web app</a>

## Tech Choices

- Create react app with typescript as template
- testing: by default create-react-app has a nice pre-config for testing-library
- setup project with eslint prettier and husky (with lint-stage) for better clean code
- css for style customization
- design : inspered from figma community and github website
- react query :Fetch, cache and update data (alternative to graphql without backend setup)
- no redux: i didn't use Redux and the reason is simpele the app doesn't has any concrete global state , and am not the kind of developer who store everything on redux, each library has his own context of use (check react query for caching data)

## Priorities

I had to prioritize more core requirements for the time that I had (sorry I had a busy week) so the design is pretty pretty simple and I didn't complete App component's test

## Demand

please i like to listen a feedback about my code. i accept any remarks and am open to suggestions. thank you
